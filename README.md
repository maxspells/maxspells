Tiger Style!
Tiger Style!
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta f wit
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta f wit
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuthin ta f wit
Yo, there's no place to hide once I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossin', enforcin', my style is awesome
I'm causin' more family feud than Richard Dawson
And the survey said, "You're dead!"
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fn' head
